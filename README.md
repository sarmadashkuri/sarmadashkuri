## Projects

### [Wheel Mini-Game + Quiz Maker](https://github.com/sarmadashkuri/web-sprint-challenge-advanced-state) 🎡
Implemented rotation functionality using basic JavaScript, allowing the user to interact with the spinning wheel. Used API calls to establish communication with the back end, allowing the user to create and take quizzes. Utilized the Redux store to manage state across the entire app, allowing the user to save their input data when navigating between components.

### [Dad Jokes Server](https://github.com/sarmadashkuri/web-sprint-challenge-authentication-and-testing) 👨
Created a database with SQL and Knex to track current and future created users’ usernames and passwords. Used Bcrypt.js to store hashed versions of users’ passwords in the database to ensure security. Restricted access to the Dad Jokes server route to authenticated and authorized users via JWT.

### [BloomTech Bar and Grill](https://github.com/sarmadashkuri/web-sprint-challenge-user-interface-responsive-design) 🍔
Built a Home page and Menu page skeleton using basic HTML elements. Used CSS to style elements on the Home page and the menu page to exactly match the requested format and styling. Created clickable social media icons that refer to their respective links via basic HTML markup.

Let's collaborate and build something amazing together! 😄
